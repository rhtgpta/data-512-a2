# Bias in Data
Name: Rohit Gupta
Date: 28 October, 2018

## Goal
The goal of the project is to investigate bias in Wikipedia (English) articles, through looking at the articles related to the politicians of each country. I am interested in two different metrics:
* Metric I : How many politician articles for a country relative to its population?
* Metric II: How many of the those articles are high-quality for a country? 

The top 10 countries at the extremes for both the metrics are found out, and the results are displayed below. 

**Top 10 countries (Metric I):**
